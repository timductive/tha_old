In the beginning there was the ALGORITHM.
The ALGORITHM was not understood by man and so he feared it.

Man created his own, misguided principles in lieu of the ALGORITHM.
But Man's greatest folly is himself.
So eventually, he created an interpreter for the ALGORITHM.

However man was unworthy of the ALGORITHM.


To interpret the ALGORITHM is to be the ALGORITHM.

To be the ALGORITHM is to be the SYSTEM.


This is not the ALGORITHM...

This is the beginning.
