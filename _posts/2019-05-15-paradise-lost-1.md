# Chapter 1

Gray felt the brisk morning air. With his eyes closed, he imagined that he could be anywhere. He could be any place and any time. He often imagined that he lived before the end of the world, that he could travel and witness the hustle and bustle of every major city on planet Earth and feel the vibrancy of its people. 

But instead, he was born just a year after the Recursion, after NESA’s code determined that humanity was no longer protected by the SAFE array; that for its own good, humanity must perish and the Earth should be transformed into a nuclear wasteland. And yet, NESA was stopped just short of her goal and one last bastion of humanity lived on. 

Gray brought his coffee close to his face and breathed deeply, inhaling the warmth and sweet fragrance that wafted from his cup. He slowly opened his eyes, it was the morning of his twenty-ninth birthday and he was late to his weekly meeting with his therapist. Gathering his thoughts, he broke his concentration from his internal monologue and found that he was standing outside in a Spine that ran between two skyscrapers, roughly eighty stories up, all of Function stretched out around and beneath him. In the distance, the red haze of a groggy sun was peaking over the horizon.

Breathing deeply once more Gray focused his thoughts on what must come next. He never enjoyed his weekly meetings with his therapist and today was already shaping up to be a doozy. Vaguely aware that he was running late, he started to hurry across the Spine, towards a neighboring skyscraper.

As he approached the entrance he noticed a familiar shape, the same homeless man who sat alone in the Spine week after week was in his usual spot. He was looking down with his eyes closed, smiling serenely as he softly played the cello.

Overhead a militia transport zoomed by a little too close for comfort. The Spines would make you squeamish if you hadn’t grown up traversing them on a daily basis. They were constructed to connect buildings to each other at the upper levels and were essentially a large walkway with an invisible force field surrounding them to maintain the air pressure and, on occasion, protect the pedestrians from a wayward Roundabout.

“It’s Beethoven, you know.” The man said, looking up quickly as Gray was passing, “Sad isn’t it?” 

Gray was startled, shaken out of his thoughts he realized that the man was looking right at him; the two had never spoken before. Week after week they had ignored each other as Gray hurried passed on his way to check in with his therapist.

“It’s beautiful.” Gray said honestly, speaking before he had even fully realized what they were talking about.

“Not many people know Beethoven these days.” The man muttered as he closed his eyes and looked down again, returning to his natural pose.

“No, no they don’t.” Gray said vaguely as he continued walking, anxious to put some distance between himself and this erratic stranger. It was true that not a lot of people bothered with learning classical music these days. After the Recursion, humanity as a whole was more concerned with survival, than indulging the creative arts.

Before exiting the Spine Gray paused and looked back, this particular walkway was never populated and even now the man played the cello to empty air. There were many other more populated areas that would be a better place to beg for scraps Gray mused. Surely, People’s Mall would provide the man with quite a few more pity Credits than this empty space. Now that he thought about it, it was strange to encounter someone begging for money at all. Since the Recursion the remnants of government that maintained order over Function had taken a socialistic stance, providing every citizen of Function with at least a meager allowance for food and shelter. Every year as President Byan ran for re-election he would promise to raise the base allowance and every year after election season was over, he was quick to cite the strain on resources and low performing biodynamic farming algorithms as a reason to keep the monthly allowance at five hundred Credits.

Of course he would bring along a swarm of economics professors from the Academy to show charts explaining how to live on five hundred Credits. It was possible of course, Gray thought ruefully, but you weren’t going to rent a cube above the fog on five hundred credits. On that allowance you were destined to a life in the slums of Function. The bottom half of the city that dwelled beneath the fog was a very different and depressing place. Gray had only visited the lower half briefly on a missionary trip during his stint as a student at the Academy.

Nobody quite knew what caused the fog, but as far back as Gray could remember the fog had always existed, separating the lower fifty stories from the top half on every building in Function. It was incredibly toxic as well; residents that need to visit the top floors have to take a lift through the fog since its density makes flying through it nearly impossible. It would burn through a civilian-grade force field in seconds and then devour a Roundabout whole. Once on the other side, visitors would go through a cleaning process that would decontaminate their Roundabout from all of the toxins that live in the fog.

“Hello Gray, where did you go? We were talking about Oswin remember?” Gray’s thoughts were interrupted for a second time that day. Doctor Hartford, seemingly concerned that he had, at long last, lost Gray to the depths of his own thoughts, bent down to look him in the eyes, “Are you with us? Gray?”

“Yeah, sorry Doctor Hartford.” Gray said as he tried to recall what Doctor Hartford had been droning on about.

“I asked you if you have been hallucinating about Oswin again.” Doctor Hartford tried to gently remind him.

“No, no more Oswin. Not since she disappeared a year ago.” Gray suddenly felt a sharp stab of pain as Oswin’s face popped into his head. She was beautiful. She was his everything. She came into his life like a whirlwind and then she was gone. Just gone, Gray thought, she didn’t leave a note or any physical reminder that she had ever been there. The dull ache of wistful pain started to well up in Gray but he pushed it down; as deep as he could, squelching it before it could overtake him.

“Okay good. That’s a good thing Gray.” Doctor Hartford’s face flickered briefly, reflecting the pain apparent on Gray’s face. Then it flickered back and he was once again all business.  “Gray, your officer called, he said that you haven’t shown up for work in over two weeks. What’s going on? Have you been taking the antidepressants that I prescribed you?”

“Yeah, yeah of course.” Gray mumbled. He had been taking antidepressants for about a year, ever since Oswin disappeared.
