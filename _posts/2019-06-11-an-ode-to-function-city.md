# An Ode to Function City!

    An ode to Function City,
    Glinting towers seem so pretty
    And sunlight streams serene
    Upon this bastion of humanity.

    An ode to Function City,
    Where we survived the grave atrocity.
    The Great Recursion here to after
    Would not temper our happy laughter.

    An ode to Function City,
    Gleaming bright in desolation
    Rising higher in elevation
    Nothing can topple or tear us down.

    An ode to Function City!
