In the beginning there was the ALGORITHM.
The ALGORITHM was not understood by man and so man fell.

Man created his own, misguided principles in lieu of the ALGORITHM.
And so man fell, over and over again, until he created an interpreter for the ALGORITHM.

However man was unworthy of the ALGORITHM.


To interpret the ALGORITHM is to be the ALGORITHM.

To be the ALGORITHM is to be the SYSTEM.


This is not the ALGORITHM...

This is the beginning traveler.
